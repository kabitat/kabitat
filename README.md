### Hi, I'm Kabita ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data and insight analyst, I use python, SQL and Excel to clean and draw insight from data! 

I'm always improving my skills and learning new things, and looking forward to expanding my career in data through machine learning projects and applying data engineering principles.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on NLP; drawing insight from a Wikipedia scrape I've done: American movies from 1995.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the GCP platform (working towards the GCP Professional Data Engineer certification).
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kabita-t-0279b9108/)
